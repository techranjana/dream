     <p>I prefer to choose the shape of the chicken and how to present it, whether it is with bones or boneless. Like a chicken burger or grilled chicken. Or other delicious recipes that I find very nice.
I love to serve salads and appetizers first. Then serve the main meal in addition to some of the side dishes that I can add to the meal. All this is very nice to me.

It contains in the menu many recipes of chicken. I would prefer to order the Portuguese style chicken.
So it contains a lot of hot spices.</p>

     <p>Eating in the restaurant is one of the good things. Since childhood, we did not encourage eating in restaurants a lot due to the loss of beneficial nutrients. The orders are always saturated with oils and fats.</p>
